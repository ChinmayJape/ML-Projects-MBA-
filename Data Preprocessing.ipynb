      "Excellent fan for an excellent price\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "It came with my new house purchase but found that it has a very narrow dispersal of light so it doesn't fill our small 15 x 20 living room well. Best suited for a smaller room such as a bedroom or dining room but not a living room... other than that it's a good quality product and I like the remote control that goes with it. Now looking for a decent replacement for my living room to get better lighting :-(\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "I purchased this fan to go in 5 rooms, my master bedroom, 2 guest bedrooms and my livingroom.  I had them all professionally installed and the only concern is that 2 of the 5 are on the same frequency which means when 1 of the guestrooms can control the fan in my masterbedroom. I'm still trying to figure that part out. I dont have guests that often so I can deal with it while I still try to figure this out.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "I purchased this fan on August 20, 2017. Love it but after the first month, I had issues with the fan. I would turn it on via remote and the fan would intermittently turn on and off a few times and then simply shut off. I would have to start the fan again several times before it finally turned on and stayed on. I called Fanimation and was told it's normal for \"calibration\" purposes. Less than a year later, the fan just stopped and I smelt the motor burning. Needless to say, the fan is beautiful and definitely an air mover when it works but I recommend if you buy this fan, you buy the warranty replacement plan with it from Lowe's. It's Friday evening on a FL summer and I can't get in touch with the manufacturer because they have limited business hours. I don't recommend this product and will not buy again.\n",
